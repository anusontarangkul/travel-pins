# travel-pins

A social media app that will inspire people to travel the world.

[Deployment](https://travel-pins.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

Do you love to travel? This app is for you. In this app, you create your own personalized account. You can view all of the countries in the world with a click. If you have traveled to a country, you can mark the country as "traveled." The country will highlight blue to show that you have traveled to the country.

You can upload your photos for each country as well! You simply click on the country you want to upload a photo to and then press the plus button to upload. This is an opportunity to keep a photo journal of your travels and share your pictures with others.

You can find other travelers as well on the app. You can search their username and follow them. Once you follow them, you can see photos about their travels on your newsfeed.

Lastly, you have your own profile account. You can see how many countries you have been to, how many followers you have, how many users follow you, and your photos.
